# Dropin - Decentralized Reforestation Platform üåçüå±

## Overview

**Dropin** is a decentralized reforestation and sustainability platform built on the **Aptos blockchain**. Leveraging **AI** and **smart contracts**, Dropin enables real-time environmental impact tracking, carbon credit generation, and gamified participation. This platform empowers individuals, NGOs, governments, and enterprises to contribute to reforestation projects, trade carbon credits, and support sustainability efforts.

The project is part of the **#EasyAConsensusHackathon** and aims to transform climate action into a transparent, efficient, and rewarding experience for all.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Environmental Tracking**: Predicts carbon sequestration rates and optimizes resource allocation for reforestation projects.
- **Aptos Blockchain Integration**: Uses Aptos smart contracts for secure, transparent transactions related to carbon credits and NFTs.
- **Gamified Participation**: Encourages user engagement through gamified elements like green lotteries, rewards, and achievements.
- **Carbon Credit Marketplace**: Facilitates the generation and trade of carbon credits, helping drive global sustainability initiatives.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Aptos
- **AI**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Smart Contracts**: Move programming language
- **Web3**: React, Web3.js, Aptos SDK
- **Cloud Storage**: IPFS (for decentralized file storage)
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js, Leaflet.js (for maps and environmental data visualizations)

## How It Works

1. **AI Prediction**: The platform collects environmental data (from IoT devices and satellite imagery) to predict carbon sequestration in different regions.
2. **Reforestation Fund Allocation**: Using AI models, resources are allocated to areas with the highest potential for carbon sequestration.
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Transactions related to funding, tree planting verification, and carbon credits are secured via Aptos smart contracts.
4. **Carbon Credit Generation & Trade**: Carbon credits are generated from verified reforestation projects and can be traded on a decentralized marketplace, powered by Aptos blockchain and Merkle Trade SDK.
5. **Gamified Rewards**: Users who participate in the reforestation efforts are rewarded with NFTs, carbon credits, and other incentives based on their engagement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Aptos CLI**: [Install Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/)
